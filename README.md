# hello-world
My first repository on Github...let's see how this goes.

I know very little about coding.  I was taught a small amount of C++ and matlab back in college but did not pursue anything further.  I wish I would have.  I am currently very interested in graphs (knowledge graphs, etc) and uncertainty in decisionmaking as feature of complex adaptive systems and human limitations in the face of that complexity.  I look forward to learning a lot more.

It will be interesting to see what my future self, who will one day look back on these notes, thinks of his older self :)
Be kind future Matt, be kind; I hope you have had a great time since you wrote these lines.
